# Divergence-Meter-CAPTCHA

Hello! This is my entry for the LaurieWired 2024 Halloween Programming Challenge.

# Overview

In order to baffle CERN's new AI system, we have developed a new CAPTCHA that takes advantage of a technology CERN does not yet have access to: The Divergence Meter.

To complete the CAPTCHA, you must use the divergence meter to input how much the world line has changed after sending a D-Mail. Good luck lab member.

# Requirements

This entry uses [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), so you will need an **internet connection** in order to load the following:

-   The p5.js library
-   The image assets used (they are hosted on imgur)

As long as you have an internet connection, everything should be loaded automatically when `index.html` is opened.

# Usage

After downloading the repo, simply open `index.html` in your web browser of choice. From there, click the "Send D-Mail" button and follow the instructions on the screen.

To restart, just refresh the web page.

Alternatively instead of downloading this repo, you can run the project via the p5.js Web Editor here: https://editor.p5js.org/Bradye1/sketches/Y_vJrJW3p

Thanks for checking out my entry!
