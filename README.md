# Divergence-Meter-CAPTCHA

Hello! This is my entry for the LaurieWired 2024 Halloween Programming Challenge.

# Overview

In order to baffle CERN's new AI system, we have developed a new CAPTCHA that takes advantage of a technology CERN does not yet have access to: The Divergence Meter.

To complete the CAPTCHA, you must use the divergence meter to input how much the world line has changed after sending a D-Mail. Good luck lab member.

# Requirements

This entry uses [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), so you will need an **internet connection** in order to load the following:

-   The p5.js library
-   The image assets used (they are hosted on imgur)

As long as you have an internet connection, everything should be loaded automatically when `src/index.html` is opened.

# Usage

After downloading the repo, simply open `src/index.html` in your web browser of choice. If images look cut off at all, please see the Troubleshooting section and also reference `example.png` to see how things should look.
From there, click the "Send D-Mail" button and follow the instructions on the screen.

To restart, just refresh the web page.

# Troubleshooting

-   If images look cut off, please try refreshing the page. It should look similar to how `example.png` looks.
-   If things still look cut off, please try zooming out in the page and refreshing again.
-   Please avoid resizing the page while the project is running.

Thanks for checking out my entry!
